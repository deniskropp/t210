  context: |
    The Klipper SDK v0.2.0 has been successfully released, providing core clipboard operations (Read, Write, Clear, Get History).
    However, the "Event System" and real-time "Monitoring" capabilities defined in the requirements are currently missing.
    The `KlipperClient` code explicitly notes that monitoring logic was deferred.
    
  objectives:
    - "Analyze the 'event_system' requirements from `docs/spec/klipper_sdk_requirements.kl`."
    - "Design the Observer Pattern implementation for the Service layer."
    - "Define the API interface for `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, and event callbacks."
    - "Plan the integration with the existing `ClipboardService` and `KlipperClient`."
    - "Create a detailed Implementation Plan (tasks/plans/016_plan.md) for v0.3.0."

  constraints:
    - "Must adhere to the existing Async/Await patterns."
    - "Must maintain backward compatibility with v0.2.0 API."
    - "Event system should be non-blocking."

  resources:
    - "docs/spec/klipper_sdk_requirements.kl"
    - "src/klipper_sdk/client/client.py"
    - "src/core/service/service.py"
